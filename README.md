This is a common setup I've used to quickly develop and deploy websites for clients mainly in the events industry. I use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for it's frontend and backend capabilities, and simple deployment to Vercel or Netlify. I use [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) as the CMS because of how customizable it is. I can then give access to meeting planners, producers, content creators, or to the client to manage content easily.

This [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Clone this repo and update the env file using the .env.example as a reference.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asmedberg/nextjs-sanity-starter.git
cd nextjs-sanity-starter
npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
